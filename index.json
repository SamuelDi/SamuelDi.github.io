Diabat√©. -- Since more than a decade, the Marine Institute has been conducting annual Ocean Climate Cruise along a route encompassing the Irish shelf and slope, the Porcupine Bank, the Rockall Trough and ending on the southern Rockall Plateau. This effort allows to monitor temporal changes in water properties such as temperature, salinity, oxygen levels, and flow speed. While satellite observations now play a crucial role in informing scientists about the ocean properties and flow at surface, in-situ measurements obtained thanks to oceanographic cruises remain vital to understand our planet climate, as they inform about the ocean interior.   On Saturday 23rd April and Sunday 24th April, scientists boarded RV Celtic Explorer in the Port of Galway and joined the crew already aboard. Later on the Sunday, we set sail and began what was my first ever research campaign at sea. Over the course of the next two weeks, we completed more than forty profiles following the historical route (MIOC# stations, see map below) and two additional transects: the North\u0026ndash;South Porcupine Section and the Erris Head section (again, see map).

They are mounted on a cylindrical metallic frame (a rosette) which is lowered from the side of the ship down to the ocean floor with use of a large winch. The Niskin bottles allow scientists to measure dissolved oxygen levels as well as other chemical compounds and elements, abundance in phyto/zoo-plankton, metal contents, etc. The rosette is also fitted with a pumped Conductivity/Temperature/Depth (CTD) sensor (a MicroCAT). For this reason, we loosely call the process of lowering the rosette and sampling the water a CTD profile.   The rosette sitting on deck before being lowered in the water (viewed from above). It is fitted with the Niskin bottles and a pumped Conductivity/Temperature/Depth (CTD) measuring instrument. Image credit: Sam T. Diabat√©. \nAboard the RV Celtic Explorer, I was the CTD operator of the night shift team, meaning I was in charge of the PC from which data acquisition and Niskin bottle closure was controlled. I was in permanent radio contact with the winch driver and with the crew members working on deck, so that we could synchronise our actions. I was also in close contact with the bio-geo-chemist team lead (Dr. Janina V. B√ºscher), who would correspond to me depth levels of interest prior to each CTD profile.\nM6 buoy successfully deployed from the #RVCelticExplorer this week during CE22008 annual climate monitoring survey 2022. @MarineInst @Eir_OOS pic.twitter.com/Z31jP0bxHy\n\u0026mdash; Marine Institute Research Vessels (@RVMarineInst) April 29, 2022  In addition to the CTD profiles, we also turned around the M6 subsurface mooring and the M6 weather buoy.

The example of the Gulf Stream and of the Kuroshio\u0026rdquo; during the Ocean Sciences Meeting 2022 (OSM22).\nThe Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio are the two great western boundary currents of the northern hemisphere. The first emerges in the eponymous Gulf of Mexico, circumnavigates Florida, follows the eastern coast of the U.S. from which it detaches at Cape Hatteras to cross the North Atlantic towards Europe. The Kuroshio emerges east of the Philippino island of Luzon, then flows between Taiwan and the Japanese archipelago of the Ry≈´ky≈´ Islands and joins the Pacific south of Japan. There, and in a similar fashion to the Gulf Stream, it detaches from the continental slope and meanders freely into the open ocean as the Kuroshio Extension.\nRegional changes of sea level forced by changes in intensity and/or path of these two currents have been studied by many researchers, but always in an independent manner, i.e. with no comparison between the two regions. With my co-authors, we compared the relationship of the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio with coastal sea-level in their adjacent regions. We found both ressemblances and divergences.\nMy talk at OSM22 presented these results, which have also been summarised in a scientific publication (read more here). My talk was part of the session \u0026ldquo;OC03, Towards understanding coastal sea-level variability and change\u0026rdquo;. A recorded working version of my intervention can be read from the player below.\nDue to COVID19, OSM22 was fully remote, as many other conferences over the past two years. This brings a number of new challenges. Nonetheless, OSM22 sessions that focused on coastal sea-level variability and change were very interesting.

It is a project which gathers scientists from different research institute: the Irish Climate Analysis and Research UnitS (ICARUS, Geography Dpt, Maynooth University), the Hamilton Institute (Maynooth University), and Trinity College Dublin (TCD). Most of us are part of ICARUS, and we effectively make up the oceanography section of this institute.\nLooking forward to the @a_ceathair annual meeting today.

This work package is led by Gerard McCarthy, while Levke Caesar and I complete the team. We work in strong connection with ROADMAP member Samantha Hallam, and PhD workers Emma Worthington (National Oceanography Centre Southampton) and Jamie Matthews (Imperial College London). We study the variability of the Gulf Stream, of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), and more broadly of the currents that make up the North Atlantic. Gerard and I also study the sea-level variability, and we are particularly interested in coastal areas, where sea-level changes are of upmost importance to humankind. Levke and Gerard have a long-standing interest for the AMOC.\nThe second package (WP2) is led by Andr√© D√ºsterhus and focuses on seasonal to decadal prediction (forecast, but on long timescales). Their work is made using statistical methods of prediction, and the outcomes of their research is quite diverse. For example, they try to create better prediction of the North Atlantic Oscillation and/or of others important proxies for Ireland weather using sea surface information (temperatures, in particular). They also work on forecasting fish population displacement around Ireland. A part of the team is also strongly focusing on statistical models of geological tide gauges, in link with work package 3.\nThe work package 3 (WP3), led by Robin Edwards, is mainly based in Trinity College Dublin and strongly function in connection with the two other work packages. Their efforts focus on reconstructing paleo sea-level variations using geological tide gauges. This is a technique which uses core sampling of salt marsh mud. Water levels are estimated based on the absence/presence of high-marsh/low-marsh species in the sample.\nThis meeting was an opportunity for me to spend a week in Ireland (I returned to France earlier this year due to the COVID19 outbreak which has forced us to solely work remotely). I was hence able to meet some new colleagues which I had only seen during video meetings. I had two very productive days with Samantha Hallam, working on tide gauge data. I was also able to spend some time with Andr√© D√ºsterhus and Levke Caesar, two colleagues that share my office in Eolas Building, North Campus, Maynooth University. Sadly, the Irish government has now announced that University should return to a strict working from home policy, in the hope to maintain COVID case numbers low. This occurs only two months after allowance to return to the office was announced. This does mean that my stay in France will continue, for now.\n","date":1637193600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637193600,"objectID":"2da501780be7b0b163fc8802bfa713ac","permalink":"https://SamuelDi.github.io/post/21-11-18-a4-annual-meeting/","publishdate":"2021-11-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/21-11-18-a4-annual-meeting/","section":"post","summary":"Today (Nov 18, 2021), the A4 team hosted the A4 annual meeting and presented some of their latest research material.

All information on this glider school can be found here: https://gliderschool.eu/.\nUnderwater gliders are now commonly used to measure ocean properties, from temperature and salinity to current velocities and oxygen levels. They are remotely controlled vehicles which glide through the water. Changing their density by inflating and deflating an external bladder allows to move them forward, while their wings control their direction. They offer a particularly energy efficient alternative to expensive research cruise. Contrarily to traditionally propelled underwater vehicles, they can last months in water.\nUnderwater gliders typically follow a sawtooth pattern when deployed, and they sample the water both during ascent and descent. When surfacing, they exchange information with mission control through Iridium, which is an open ocean internet connection working thanks to satellites.\nGliders are a part of the fleet at disposition at the Marine Institute, Co. Galway. For our research on the European Slope Currents, a glider was deployed in Spring 2020 on the northwest European shelf-edge. Further deployments are now under examination.\nFrom Monday 25 October to Friday 29 October, I followed a one-week glider training hosted in PLOCAN, the Oceanographic platform of the Canary Islands. This glider school provided theoretical and practical training in underwater gliders to students coming from Europe and elsewhere in the world.\n#OceanGlider lab still busy \u0026amp; crowded practicing on @SeaExplorerUUV technology setting up glider units for tomorrow‚Äôs deployment \u0026amp; piloting in open waters @EUMarineRobots @EuroGOOS @Euro_Sea @Groom2RI @OceanPractices @TechOceanS #ICTSNews @agenciaiisi @plocan #GliderSchool2021 pic.twitter.com/SkLjWGN9wJ\n\u0026mdash; Carlos Barrera (@GliderPLOCAN) October 28, 2021  The glider school allowed me and the other students to manipulate the Slocum and Seaexplorer gliders, respectively from Teledyne and Alseamar. We also trained to use a surface vehicle, the Wave Glider from Liquid Robotics. This vehicle relies on wave energy to move forward, making it, similarly to underwater glider, a (relatively) cheap technology. We had the opportunity to dismantle the gliders, review the remote control options offered by the glider manufacturers, and deploy the vehicles in the ocean.\nThis glider school was superb in many aspects. I feel very honoured to have met other scientists and doctorands working in subjects related to what I am doing. While the school was hard work, relaxing by the sea in the evening with the others allowed us to get to know one another. The water was as warm as the air (23¬∞ C) for most of the week, although the air temperature rose by Friday. This meant we could all enjoy some evening swims, which is an unusual thing to do during the last week of October.

This is the first paper that I lead-authored. This paper was published yesterday on the Ocean Science journal website. The work which led to this paper was entirely supervised by Gerard McCarthy, who is the second main author of this paper. The other co-authors are Didier Swingedouw, Jo√´l Hirschi, Aur√©lie Duchez, Philip Leadbitter and Ivan Haigh. In this blog post I propose a brief, plain language, summary of our results and their implications.\n The entry on my website for this peer-reviewed publication can be found here. The article on the publisher website is here. The PDF is freely available here.   Let me give a bit of context first. Due to global warming, sea level is rising across the globe. Interestingly however, this slow process is far from the only driver of sea-level variability. A common example known to most are the tides. Tides make the sea level rise and drop at diurnal and semi-diurnal frequencies (and others, I am not entering details here). Another example is the seasonal cycle: because the water is warmer in summer, water levels are found higher during this period of the year. At longer timescales \u0026mdash; yet shorter than the human-induced sea-level rise \u0026mdash; sea-level changes are dominated by the ocean internal variability. Water within the ocean is slowly moved around through changes in the transport and/or path of oceanic currents, through the westward propagation of eddies (large-scale swirls) or large-scale waves (known as Rossby waves), and through other processes. These mechanisms, together with change in ocean heat content, influence the pluri-annual to multidecadal variability of sea level, in a manner which differs from one location to another.\nThe variability of the sea level along the coast of Japan and of the east USA has received a lot of attention in recent years. This is in part because it is thought to be under the influence of the close-by Kuroshio and Gulf Stream, which are western boundary currents closing the subtropical gyres of the North Pacific and North Atlantic respectively. They are northwestward flowing jets which carry warm water towards high latitudes. A greater appreciation of the sea-level drivers could allow scientists to better understand these western boundary currents which are of great importance to the climate system. Also, the US and Japanese eastern seaboards are two of the most densely populated coastlines in the world. Hence, a greater understanding of sea-level variability in these regions could improve our response to the sea level related threat in a warming world.\nWe found that the sea-level variability south of Japan and in the South Atlantic Bight is correlated to the north to south path shifts of the Kuroshio and of the Gulf Stream respectively. To be more precise, the coastal sea level in the upstream region (where the western boundary current flows along the coast) goes up when the western boundary current shifts north downstream of their detachment point. This relationship is illustrated in the figure above, which is adapted from one of my talks. The panels present in shadings the comparison between the coastal sea-level in the US South Atlantic Bight (left) or south of Japan (right) and sea surface velocity magnitudes (well, sort of\u0026hellip; I am keeping it simple here). The shadings represent the difference between sea surface velocity magnitudes averaged over periods of high coastal sea level and over periods of low coastal sea levels. These composites inform us on how the western boundary current paths changed when sea level changed. It is apparent in these panels that sea surface velocity magnitudes drifted to the north when the sea level was high. In both oceans, this relationship had been previously observed, but only for the recent period when satellite measurements are available (that is, in this case, from 1993 onwards). We showed using indices based on ocean temperature profiles and tide gauges that this connection holds for the longer periods of 1948‚Äì2019 for the Atlantic and 1968‚Äì2019 for the Pacific.\nThe exact mechanisms which connects the upstream sea level and the path changes downstream are still unclear and may be relatively involved. Yoshi Sasaki and colleagues proposed that the two were linked through the propagation and breaking of oceanic large-scale waves (thousand of kilometers large!). Their theory, developped for the North Pacific, is particularly interesting. Other theories involve the western boundary current temperature, transport, or upstream paths (as opposed to downstream paths).\nI thank the anonymous referee as well as Dr. Tal Ezer for their reviewing work.

For an in-depth analysis of the effect that this beach disappearance has on place attachment and on individual and community well-being, see the wonderful paper from Chris Phillips (Maynooth University scholar) on solastalgia: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-021-01778-y.\n","date":1618358400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618358400,"objectID":"241c712e695c5b809a801b94f99d7048","permalink":"https://SamuelDi.github.io/post/21-04-14-turning-around-the-gauge-in-courtown/","publishdate":"2021-04-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/21-04-14-turning-around-the-gauge-in-courtown/","section":"post","summary":"In April 2021, we spend a day with Gerard McCarthy turning around the tide gauge in Courtown harbour, Ireland.

We graduated in September 2019.\nMost of us now work in oceanography, meteorology, or related fields. In particular,\n Fernand works on turbulent mixing and internal tides in the equatorial Atlantic. His first lead-authored paper can be accessed here https://doi.org/10.3390/fluids5030147. Arnaud works on dynamical changes of sandy beach in the Gulf of Guinea. Last research can be seen here: https://doi.org/10.1190/INT-2021-0023.1. Thierry and Adeola have co-authored papers which can be found online. Keep an eye out for the others!
