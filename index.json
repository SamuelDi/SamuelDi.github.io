They transport warm water northward and are key components of the Earth climate system. For this study, we looked at how they affect the sea level of the coasts of Japan, the USA and Canada. We found that the inshore sea level co-varies with the north-to-south shifts of the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio. In the paper, we discuss the physical mechanisms that could explain the agreement.","tags":["Sea Level","Western Boundary Currents","Tide Gauges"],"title":"Western boundary circulation and coastal sea-level variability in Northern Hemisphere oceans","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sam Tiéfolo Diabaté","Didier Swingedouw","Joël Jean-Marie Hirschi","Aurélie Duchez","Philip J.

Courtown is located south of Dublin and faces the Irish Sea. The tides of Courtown are particularly interesting (they are quarter-diurnal at neaps). Changing tides are one of the plausible reasons for the disapearing beach just a few tens of meters to the north of Courtown port. For an in-depth analysis of the effect that this beach disappearance has on place attachment and on individual and community well-being, see the wonderful paper from Chris Phillips (Maynooth University scholar) on solastalgia: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-021-01778-y.\n","date":1618358400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618358400,"objectID":"e588c5b0620ebc12b5ed74269c1bb838","permalink":"https://samueldi.github.io/post/21-12-23-a-souvenir-from-courtown/","publishdate":"2021-04-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/21-12-23-a-souvenir-from-courtown/","section":"post","summary":"Turning around the tide gauge in Courtown port, Ireland.\n","tags":null,"title":"A Souvenir from Courtown, Ireland","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This is an ideal test for this first website!
