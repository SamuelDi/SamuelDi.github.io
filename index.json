Using altimetry-obtained measurements and a wind reanalysis, we demonstrate in the present contribution how the sub-annual sea-level variability can be understood as a response to the wind action. The winds drive water towards (away from) the coastline through Ekman transport, yielding sea-level changes coherent along and across the shelf and with maximum amplitude at the coast. The alignment of the winds with the isobaths determines the magnitude of sea-level changes. To investigate the impacts of these changes on the circulation variability, we bring together a comprehensive dataset of 30+ in-situ observations of recent current changes. Using these measurements, we show that sub-annual changes in the shelf-edge circulation from the Goban Spur to the Faroe-Shetland Channel arise from the geostrophic adjustment to shelf sea-level variations induced by the Ekman-driven accumulation of water towards the coastline. Our analysis suggests that the along-isobath current generated through this mechanism are primarily found over the shelf, only impinge on the upper slope, and do not affect the circulation above greater depth (500 m). Nonetheless, important slope circulations such as the Rockall Slope Current are substantially influenced on their shoreward side by this simple geostrophic adjustment process. Because sea-level changes co-vary over large distances on the shelf, there also is remarkable along-isobath coherence in the associated current changes but we warn against concluding this is evidence for the continuity of an ‘European Slope Current’ circumnavigating the European slope from Portugal to Norway.","tags":["Sea Level","Shelf variability","In-situ currents","Wind forcing","Rockall slope current","European slope current","Sub-annual timescales"],"title":"On the wind-driven European shelf sea-level variability and the associated oceanic circulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"After submitting my PhD thesis in last February, I successfully defended my doctorate during my viva voce on the 1st May, 2024.

In July I had the opportunity to join a SAMS delegation of researcher, technicians and students to take part in the 2022 campaign of the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP) whose primary aim was to turn around the main observing array of the \u0026lsquo;conveyor belt\u0026rsquo; circulation in the subpolar North Atlantic.\nThe Atlantic Overturning Meridional Circulation (AMOC) is a system of northward surface currents and equatorward deep currents in the North Atlantic forming the Great Ocean Conveyor Belt. It plays a major role in the redistribution of heat on our planet, therefore affecting the climate we live in. The AMOC is driven by subtle thermohaline density differences in the ocean, and is projected to collapse in the coming centuries due to anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Such collapse would have catastrophic influences on Northern Hemisphere temperature and precipitation regimes, and on on North Atlantic sea levels, among other things. The AMOC is hence particularly observed. The Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP) is an observational mooring array which monitors the strength of the AMOC. It consists of numerous moorings anchored between the Labrador province of Canada, the southern tip of Greenland and Scotland (see schematic below).\n  OSNAP array schematic. Mooring positions are indicated by the black vertical lines, while yellow circular markers represent floatations and red circular markers, sensors. The system of currents of the AMOC and of the subpolar gyre is also represented. Image credit: OSNAP.  The main goal of our cruise, labelled JC238, was to turn around moorings deployed between the Icelandic Basin and Scotland during the previous campaign (2020), allowing to maintain and extend OSNAP as an 8 year old ocean observing system. Turning moorings around is essential to retrieve data collected by moored instruments and to allow for their reconditioning and redeployment. For each mooring, a retrieval of the old line and deployment of a new one must be performed. During the former, the mooring line with its instruments are brought in aboard the ship. Deployment is the reverse operation, where a new line with re-fitted instruments is put in the water. Both operations typically last several hours (depending on mooring line length and number of instruments installed).\nThe JC238 campaign took place between July 8th and July 31st, 2022 on the Royal Research Vessel James Cook, which we embarked in Southampton \u0026mdash; right in front of the National Oceanography Centre. The James Cook is a large ship for a research vessel, and certainly is the biggest I sailed on. It can host 30+ scientists on board, and approximately 20 crew and technicians. It\u0026#39;s proving to be a busy week for our Research Ships!\nToday #RRSJamesCook departed to the North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre on #JC238.

Image credit: Sam T. Diabaté.  It took the ship two days to sail through the English Channel and Irish Sea all the way to the shelf-edge west of Scotland. From there we proceeded to turn around the OSNAP moorings from east to west, up to approximately the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (see schematic above). There, the US Research Vessel Neil Armstrong took over as planned to continue turning around moorings towards Greenland.\nOur job done, we sailed back towards the British-Irish Isles. After having picked up a last mooring North of Scotland, the team of SAMS scientists (including me) was dropped off on July 28th in Ardmucknish Bay in front of SAMS, while the rest of the scientists, the technicians and the crew disembarked in Southampton on July 31st.\n  Unscrewing from its syntactic buoy a long-range ADCP, after it was brought in the hangar. Pic taken by Dr. Lewis Drysdale.  On the ship, I worked as part of the SAMS mooring operation team together with Dr. Lewis Drysdale and Estelle Dumont. We worked in close relationship with the UK National Marine Facilities (NMF) technicians onboard. During mooring retrievals and deployments, I assisted Lewis and Estelle on the aft-deck of the ship. Prior to turnarounds, we calibrated and prepared sensors to be deployed. We fitted them with new batteries, set sampling parameters and checked their good operation. For calibration, we mounted the temperature and salinity sensors (microCATS) on the CTD rosette which was casted to perform calibration dips.\nI was also in charge of the editing and processing of current-meter data obtained from the moored ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) instruments. Lastly, I was tasked with half a dozen of marine mammal watches. These had to be completed before ramping up the swath sonar bathymetry imaging, which can be harmful to marine mammals. I was specifically trained as a marine mammal observer prior to the campaign and particularly enjoyed doing this job during JC238.\n  A step forward in time with Adeola Dahunsi. The picture on the left was taken in December 2018, when Adeola and I were classmates of the Master Oceanography \u0026amp; Applications.

We took the awesome selfie shown on the right a couple of hours before I disembarked in Ardmucknish Bay with the other SAMS scientists. Image credit: Adeola Dahunsi \u0026amp; Sam Diabaté.  Above all, cruise JC238 was for me an extraordinary human adventure. Lewis and Estelle were exceptionally kind and helpful. I learned a lot alongside them. I am also delighted to have met new colleagues and seen some familiar faces too! In particular I had great pleasure finding Adeola Dahunsi again after several years. Adeola and I were classmates during the academic year 2018 \u0026ndash; 2019. We took the Master Oceanography \u0026amp; Applications taking place in Cotonou (Benin) and coordinated by University Toulouse III (France) and University of Abomey-Calavi (Benin). At the time, I was coming from Toulouse, while Adeola was joining from Nigeria. At the end of this Master, I went on to start my PhD here in Ireland (in November 2019), while Adeola then studied one year in Ghana before returning to Benin to start a PhD on sea wave dynamics and sediment transport in the Gulf of Guinea. Some of his work can be read here. I didn\u0026rsquo;t knew about Adeola would take part in JC238 as a junior scientist, nor did he knew that I was joining with the scientists from SAMS: we only realised we would see each other again a few weeks ahead of the cruise. It was a blessing to see Adeola again. Together we had plenty of fun, and I am very happy that we got to spend a bit of time together. We helped each other out with some of the work too. I was also delighted to meet the other early carreer scientists onboard and wish them all the best in their research career.\nToday we stopped at Oban to disembark scientists from @SAMSoceannews .

Our primary goal was to recover three moorings located southwest of Ireland, on an offshore underwater plateau known as Goban Spur. This campaign was carried out as a collaboration between three different ocean research institutions: 1) Maynooth University with scientists from the A4 project; 2) the Marine Institute; and 3) the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (in German, Bundesamt für Seeschifffahrt und Hydrographie, or BSH).\nMoorings are instrument arrays anchored on the sea floor which sample the water column for an extended amount of time (from months to years). In recent years, a network of moorings has been measuring water properties at the Goban Spur (13°E, 49°N). In 2016, German scientists of BSH (the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany) deployed three EB moorings on the deeper part of the Goban Spur, while in 2020, the Marine Institute filled in the gap between the German moorings and the Irish coastline with additional EBS moorings. The mooring geographical locations, reminding of the \u0026lsquo;OMEX\u0026rsquo; mooring array deployed in the mid-90s, were chosen to close the eastern boundary of the NOAC line, a basinwide mooring array measuring the North Atlantic conveyor belt circulation.\n  (a) General bathymetry map of the region Southwest of Ireland, showing also the mooring locations as colour filled circle) as well as the planned and effective CTD stations displayed as light and dark crosses.

(b) Zoom in on the Goban Spur, where most of the action took place. Markers are the same as on (a), only planned CTD stations are not shown. Image credit: Gerard D. McCarthy.  While moorings EB2 and EBS3 were lost, possibly due to trawling activity, three Goban Spur moorings (EB3, EB1 and EBS1) and one shallow mooring (EBS5) sampled the ocean for an extended period. Recovery of these moorings was the primary goal of our cruise. These mooring locations are shown on the map above. The campaign was conducted on the RV Tom Crean between September 24th and 30th, and the principal investigator was Dr. Gerard McCarthy, my PhD supervisor.\nThe Maynooth University team, which was composed of Dr. Gerard McCarthy, Dr. Levke Caesar, Dr. André Düsterhus, Dr. Samantha Hallam, Dr. Stephen Ogungbenro and myself, met up with Dr. Manuela Köllner and Tobias Svensson from BSH on the Friday 23/09. We embarked the RV Tom Crean on the following day, joining Dr. Eoghan Daly, Alan Berry and Conall O' Malley from the Marine Institute as well as the ship\u0026rsquo;s crew. We set sail on that day. Mooring EB3 was recovered on Monday 26/09. Rougher weather hindered mooring recovery until the Thursday 29/09, and the elapsed time was used as best as possible to conduct CTD profiles (Don\u0026rsquo;t know what CTD stations are? Find out more info here).\n  Dr. Gerard McCarthy and Dr. Eoghan Daly on a coffee break. Image credit: Sam T. Diabaté.  Mooring EBS1 and EB1 were recovered on the Thursday 29/09, and it was decided to sail towards land immediately after because of the sea condition worsening. We fled ahead of the storm and reached \u0026mdash; not without trouble \u0026mdash; Galway Bay on the evening of Friday 29/09. We disembarked on the following morning.\nTogether with Dr. Samantha Hallam, I cleaned up the moored instruments recovered from the mooring lines, downloaded the data from the MicroCATs, set up the instruments for calibration dips, and more broadly facilitated the smooth running of the mooring operations headed by Dr. Manuela Köllner (for EB1 and EB3) and Conall O' Malley (for EBS1). I was also in charge of the Vessel Mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (VmADCP), which is an instrument designed to measure the water velocity (currents) of the water column below the ship keel. The VmADCP aboard the RV Tom Crean is a Pinnacle 45 from Teledyne RDI, a particularly modern instrument which allows to perform a novel acquisition method referred to as \u0026lsquo;interleaved\u0026rsquo;. This new method comes with new processing challenges, which I was able to circumvent with help of Pr. Jules Hummon of University of Hawaii who was contacted by mail. Next month, Gerard and I will be taking part in a workshop organised by Dr. Eoghan Daly on VmADCP acquisition and data processing.\n  The RV Tom Crean in Galway harbour on demobilisation day.

I was in particular impressed by the features of the dry laboratory. Scientists can now operate the CTD winch from a designated desk in the dry lab, provided the bridge has granted us control. The different screens in the lab are all connected to a central PC unit, and everything is accessible from a server, allowing researchers to quickly work on different ongoing measurements at a time (VmADC Profiling, but also swath bathymetry measurements, underway systems, CTD monitoring, etc.). The ship design makes life aboard comfortable and easy, with a gym, a TV space, a very comfortable dining room facing the galley, and plenty of room to work.\nAs on previous cruises I took part in, pods of common dolphins and pilot whales were common encounters. A camera was installed on the hull and allowed to see dolphins having great fun right beneath us. Colleagues Dr. Samantha Hallam and Alan Berry shared some wonderful footages on their social media, some of which can be seen below.

This effort allows to monitor temporal changes in water properties such as temperature, salinity, oxygen levels, and flow speed. While satellite observations now play a crucial role in informing scientists about the ocean properties and flow at surface, in-situ measurements obtained thanks to oceanographic cruises remain vital to understand our planet climate, as they inform about the ocean interior.   On Saturday 23rd April and Sunday 24th April, scientists boarded RV Celtic Explorer in the Port of Galway and joined the crew already aboard. Later on the Sunday, we set sail and began what was my first ever research campaign at sea.

It is a project which gathers scientists from different research institute: the Irish Climate Analysis and Research UnitS (ICARUS, Geography Dpt, Maynooth University), the Hamilton Institute (Maynooth University), and Trinity College Dublin (TCD). Most of us are part of ICARUS, and we effectively make up the oceanography section of this institute.\nLooking forward to the @a_ceathair annual meeting today. We\u0026#39;ve had to move everything online so send a message if you\u0026#39;d like to join and I\u0026#39;ll forward the link. pic.twitter.com/yZC4jk5OG4\n\u0026mdash; A4: Aigéin, Aeráid, \u0026amp; athrú Atlantaigh (@a_ceathair) November 18, 2021  The first work package (WP1), which I am part of, focuses on the large scale Atlantic variability (currents, heat transport, heat exchanges, etc.). This work package is led by Gerard McCarthy, while Levke Caesar and I complete the team. We work in strong connection with ROADMAP member Samantha Hallam, and PhD workers Emma Worthington (National Oceanography Centre Southampton) and Jamie Matthews (Imperial College London). We study the variability of the Gulf Stream, of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), and more broadly of the currents that make up the North Atlantic. Gerard and I also study the sea-level variability, and we are particularly interested in coastal areas, where sea-level changes are of upmost importance to humankind. Levke and Gerard have a long-standing interest for the AMOC.\nThe second package (WP2) is led by André Düsterhus and focuses on seasonal to decadal prediction (forecast, but on long timescales). Their work is made using statistical methods of prediction, and the outcomes of their research is quite diverse. For example, they try to create better prediction of the North Atlantic Oscillation and/or of others important proxies for Ireland weather using sea surface information (temperatures, in particular). They also work on forecasting fish population displacement around Ireland. A part of the team is also strongly focusing on statistical models of geological tide gauges, in link with work package 3.\nThe work package 3 (WP3), led by Robin Edwards, is mainly based in Trinity College Dublin and strongly function in connection with the two other work packages. Their efforts focus on reconstructing paleo sea-level variations using geological tide gauges. This is a technique which uses core sampling of salt marsh mud. Water levels are estimated based on the absence/presence of high-marsh/low-marsh species in the sample.\nThis meeting was an opportunity for me to spend a week in Ireland (I returned to France earlier this year due to the COVID19 outbreak which has forced us to solely work remotely). I was hence able to meet some new colleagues which I had only seen during video meetings. I had two very productive days with Samantha Hallam, working on tide gauge data. I was also able to spend some time with André Düsterhus and Levke Caesar, two colleagues that share my office in Eolas Building, North Campus, Maynooth University. Sadly, the Irish government has now announced that University should return to a strict working from home policy, in the hope to maintain COVID case numbers low. This occurs only two months after allowance to return to the office was announced. This does mean that my stay in France will continue, for now.\n","date":1637193600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637193600,"objectID":"2da501780be7b0b163fc8802bfa713ac","permalink":"https://SamuelDi.github.io/post/21-11-18-a4-annual-meeting/","publishdate":"2021-11-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/21-11-18-a4-annual-meeting/","section":"post","summary":"Today (Nov 18, 2021), the A4 team hosted the A4 annual meeting and presented some of their latest research material.

All information on this glider school can be found here: https://gliderschool.eu/.\nUnderwater gliders are now commonly used to measure ocean properties, from temperature and salinity to current velocities and oxygen levels. They are remotely controlled vehicles which glide through the water. Changing their density by inflating and deflating an external bladder allows to move them forward, while their wings control their direction. They offer a particularly energy efficient alternative to expensive research cruise. Contrarily to traditionally propelled underwater vehicles, they can last months in water.\nUnderwater gliders typically follow a sawtooth pattern when deployed, and they sample the water both during ascent and descent. When surfacing, they exchange information with mission control through Iridium, which is an open ocean internet connection working thanks to satellites.\nGliders are a part of the fleet at disposition at the Marine Institute, Co. Galway. For our research on the European Slope Currents, a glider was deployed in Spring 2020 on the northwest European shelf-edge. Further deployments are now under examination.\nFrom Monday 25 October to Friday 29 October, I followed a one-week glider training hosted in PLOCAN, the Oceanographic platform of the Canary Islands. This glider school provided theoretical and practical training in underwater gliders to students coming from Europe and elsewhere in the world.\n#OceanGlider lab still busy \u0026amp; crowded practicing on @SeaExplorerUUV technology setting up glider units for tomorrow’s deployment \u0026amp; piloting in open waters @EUMarineRobots @EuroGOOS @Euro_Sea @Groom2RI @OceanPractices @TechOceanS #ICTSNews @agenciaiisi @plocan #GliderSchool2021 pic.twitter.com/SkLjWGN9wJ\n\u0026mdash; Carlos Barrera (@GliderPLOCAN) October 28, 2021  The glider school allowed me and the other students to manipulate the Slocum and Seaexplorer gliders, respectively from Teledyne and Alseamar. We also trained to use a surface vehicle, the Wave Glider from Liquid Robotics. This vehicle relies on wave energy to move forward, making it, similarly to underwater glider, a (relatively) cheap technology. We had the opportunity to dismantle the gliders, review the remote control options offered by the glider manufacturers, and deploy the vehicles in the ocean.\nThis glider school was superb in many aspects. I feel very honoured to have met other scientists and doctorands working in subjects related to what I am doing. While the school was hard work, relaxing by the sea in the evening with the others allowed us to get to know one another. The water was as warm as the air (23° C) for most of the week, although the air temperature rose by Friday. This meant we could all enjoy some evening swims, which is an unusual thing to do during the last week of October.

This is the first paper that I lead-authored. This paper was published yesterday on the Ocean Science journal website. The work which led to this paper was entirely supervised by Gerard McCarthy, who is the second main author of this paper. The other co-authors are Didier Swingedouw, Joël Hirschi, Aurélie Duchez, Philip Leadbitter and Ivan Haigh. In this blog post I propose a brief, plain language, summary of our results and their implications.\n The entry on my website for this peer-reviewed publication can be found here. The article on the publisher website is here. The PDF is freely available here.   Let me give a bit of context first. Due to global warming, sea level is rising across the globe. Interestingly however, this slow process is far from the only driver of sea-level variability. A common example known to most are the tides. Tides make the sea level rise and drop at diurnal and semi-diurnal frequencies (and others, I am not entering details here). Another example is the seasonal cycle: because the water is warmer in summer, water levels are found higher during this period of the year. At longer timescales \u0026mdash; yet shorter than the human-induced sea-level rise \u0026mdash; sea-level changes are dominated by the ocean internal variability. Water within the ocean is slowly moved around through changes in the transport and/or path of oceanic currents, through the westward propagation of eddies (large-scale swirls) or large-scale waves (known as Rossby waves), and through other processes. These mechanisms, together with change in ocean heat content, influence the pluri-annual to multidecadal variability of sea level, in a manner which differs from one location to another.\nThe variability of the sea level along the coast of Japan and of the east USA has received a lot of attention in recent years. This is in part because it is thought to be under the influence of the close-by Kuroshio and Gulf Stream, which are western boundary currents closing the subtropical gyres of the North Pacific and North Atlantic respectively. They are northeastward flowing jets which carry warm water towards high latitudes. A greater appreciation of the sea-level drivers could allow scientists to better understand these western boundary currents which are of great importance to the climate system. Also, the US and Japanese eastern seaboards are two of the most densely populated coastlines in the world. Hence, a greater understanding of sea-level variability in these regions could improve our response to the sea level related threat in a warming world.\nWe found that the sea-level variability south of Japan and in the South Atlantic Bight is correlated to the north to south path shifts of the Kuroshio and of the Gulf Stream respectively. To be more precise, the coastal sea level in the upstream region (where the western boundary current flows along the coast) goes up when the western boundary current shifts north downstream of their detachment point. This relationship is illustrated in the figure above, which is adapted from one of my talks. The panels present in shadings the comparison between the coastal sea-level in the US South Atlantic Bight (left) or south of Japan (right) and sea surface velocity magnitudes (well, sort of\u0026hellip; I am keeping it simple here). The shadings represent the difference between sea surface velocity magnitudes averaged over periods of high coastal sea level and over periods of low coastal sea levels. These composites inform us on how the western boundary current paths changed when sea level changed. It is apparent in these panels that sea surface velocity magnitudes drifted to the north when the sea level was high. In both oceans, this relationship had been previously observed, but only for the recent period when satellite measurements are available (that is, in this case, from 1993 onwards). We showed using indices based on ocean temperature profiles and tide gauges that this connection holds for the longer periods of 1948–2019 for the Atlantic and 1968–2019 for the Pacific.\nThe exact mechanisms which connects the upstream sea level and the path changes downstream are still unclear and may be relatively involved. Yoshi Sasaki and colleagues proposed that the two were linked through the propagation and breaking of oceanic large-scale waves (thousand of kilometers large!). Their theory, developped for the North Pacific, is particularly interesting. Other theories involve the western boundary current temperature, transport, or upstream paths (as opposed to downstream paths).\nI thank the anonymous referee as well as Dr. Tal Ezer for their reviewing work. I also thank all my co-authors for their hard work!\nCheers,\nS.\n The entry on my website for this peer-reviewed publication can be found here. The article on the publisher website is here.
